# Health Care Data Analysis

‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organise appointments, track past medical records and provide e-prescriptions.

So, companies like ‘BeHealthy’ are providing medical services, prescriptions and online consultations and generating huge data day by day.

Let’s take a look at the following snippet of medical data that may be generated when a doctor is writing notes to his/her patient or as a review of a therapy that he or she has done.

“The patient was a 62-year-old man with squamous cell lung cancer, which was first successfully treated by a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.” 

As you can see in this text, a person with a non-medical background cannot understand the various medical terms. We have taken a simple sentence from a medical data set to understand the problem and where you can understand the terms ‘cancer’ and ‘chemotherapy’. 

## Business Goal:
 
Build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.

We have been asked to determine the disease name and its probable treatment from the dataset and list it out in the form of a table or a dictionary like this.

## Expected Tasks
#### There are eight major tasks that you need to perform to complete the assignment.

- Data preprocessing
- Concept identification
- Defining the features for CRF
- Getting the features words and sentences
- Defining input and target variables
- Building the model
- Evaluating the model
- Identifying the diseases and predicted treatment using a custom NER
